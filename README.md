# Financial Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project implements a **machine learning model** to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It uses historical transaction data to predict whether a transaction is **safe** or **fraudulent**, helping banks and financial institutions reduce losses from fraud.

---

## Features
- Classifies transactions as **Safe** or **Fraudulent** using machine learning.
- Works with numerical features (C1–V28) from the dataset.
- Easy-to-use interface (optional: can integrate with a simple web app for predictions).

---

## Dataset
- The model uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** (publicly available on Kaggle).
- Dataset contains anonymized transaction features labeled as **fraudulent or safe**.
- Features include C1–C28, Time, and Amount.

---

## Model
- Model used: **[Your model type, e.g., Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost]**
- Preprocessing:
  - Feature scaling with **StandardScaler**.
  - Data split into **training and testing sets**.
- Evaluates performance with metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
